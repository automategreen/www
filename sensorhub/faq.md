# Sensor Hub FAQ

### When will my credit card be charged?

> We will not charge your credit card until the Sensor Hub is ready to ship.

### When will my Sensor Hub ship?

> Our goal is to begin shipping pre-orders in late 2016.  Because of all the unknowns with developing a new product, we cannot promise a ship date, but we will try our best to stay on schedule.

### Will Automate Green provide updates of the project's progress?

> Yes.  If you place a pre-order, you will automatically receive an email to sign-up for our Hub mailing list.  We will send updates to the mailing list once or twice a month.  We do not like to read marketing emails and like even less to write them, so we promise to respect your email.

### I did not pre-order a Sensor Hub.  Can I still get updates?

> You can sign-up for the Sensor Hub mailing list below.
